    <h1>Parallel Rush Hour Solver</h1>
    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "It will take more than a little skilled driving to get the red car out of this traffic jam â€“ it will take brainpower. In <a href="https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/">Rush Hour</a>, a sliding block logic game, you have to battle the gridlock as you slide the blocking vehicles out of the way for the red car to exit. With 40 all-new challenges, ranging in difficulty, players can progress at their own speed. As one of the best logic games of all time, Rush Hour is a must for every household."
    </blockquote>
    <p>The goal is to move the red car wholly to the right, where it can exit the board. All the other cars can be moved in either <i>X</i> or <i>Y</i> direction.
    <h2>The Solver</h2>      
    <p>This solver is implemented in <a href="https://potassco.org/clingo/">Clingo</a>, a solver for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming">Answer Set Problems</a>. Clingo is wrapped in PHP and responds with the shortest plan.</p>
    <p>
      The solver exhibits the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is wholly declarative. No algorithm is ever specified in the Clingo code.</li>
      <li>It takes parallel moves into account. That is, several cars can move at once.</li>
      <li>It finds the optimal solution in regards to the number of turns needed, if there is one. This is realized through the <i>incremental</i> solving feature of clingo.</li>
      <li>It is in the public domain. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/firefrorefiddle/rushhour_solver">at Github</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>The Instance</h2>
    This instance is taken from <a href="http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/algo/secollet/papers/crs06.pdf">a paper</a> by Collette, Raskin and Servals. According to the paper, it takes 93 (single-step) moves to solve. We actually solve it in 46 moves, because we add parallelism.
